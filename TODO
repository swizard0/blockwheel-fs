- think about "block repay" mechanism: do we really need it?
- add stats about lend/repay in `Info`
- fill defrag queue after blockwheel file opening
- no defrag space key: use block id instead
- defrag queue priority: merge 2 spaces first

- space gap is deleted but it was stored in defrag task: deleted block entry environs checking failed
